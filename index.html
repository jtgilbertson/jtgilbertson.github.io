                        Hi there! I'm a veteran and ASU alum looking for 
                        a career change. I currently work at Midwestern 
                        University in the Student Services department, and
                        would like to start a career in IT.

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>
                        I'm 32 years old and a Phoenix native. I served in 
                        the Air Force for six years doing Water & Fuel
                        Systems Maintenance (plumbing). My plan was to stay
                        in the military, as long as I could switch jobs. 
                        Each time I tried, I was declined due to manning.
                        <br><br>
                        Once my six-year contract was up, I decided that
                        instead of re-enlisting I would just go to college. 
                        I then started going to school at ASU for Information
                        Technology in 2019 and graduated in May 2023. 
                        <br><br>
                        Now that I've graduated, I'm hoping to start a career
                        in IT. My main interests are web development and 
                        cybersecurity, however, I'm up for anything. As long 
                        as I'm being challenged and learning new things 
                        regularly, I'll be happy.
                        <br><br>
                        Outside of work, I enjoy hanging out with family
                        and friends, watching UFC fights, going to the gym,
                        walking my dogs, and going hiking when I can. I'm a 
                        pretty easygoing guy so I'm positive we'll get along :)
